# Optimizing Store Placement using Spatial Regression and Customer Density Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes geospatial data to optimize store placement strategies.  It leverages spatial regression techniques and customer density prediction models to identify optimal locations for new stores and improve the performance of existing ones. The analysis incorporates competitor locations and demographic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of market potential and spatial relationships.  The project aims to maximize profitability by strategically placing stores in areas with high predicted customer density and minimal competitive overlap.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Geopandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels (or other suitable spatial regression library)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the analysis and generate the outputs described in the next section.  Make sure your data files (as specified within the code) are in the correct location.


## Example Output

The script produces the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis including key statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared for regression models), and insights derived from the analysis.  This will include summaries of customer density predictions and the identified optimal store locations.

* **Plot Files:**  Various visualization files (e.g., `customer_density_map.png`, `competitor_analysis.png`) will be generated in the project directory. These plots illustrate the spatial distribution of customer density, competitor locations, and the identified optimal store locations.  Specific plot names may vary depending on the analysis performed.

## Data

The project requires specific data files (e.g., customer transaction data, competitor locations, demographic data).  Please refer to the `data` directory and the code for details on the required data format and file names.  Example data may be provided, but it's recommended to replace this with your own data for accurate and relevant analysis.
